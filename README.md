### Hi, I'm Mathieu

I'm a researcher in mathematical optimization, soon joining [Inria Grenoble](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-centre-university-grenoble-alpes) as an Associate Researcher.
I'm interested in developing methods for various classes of optimization problems leveraging generic and specific problem structures. The classes I am looking at include Mixed-Integer (Non)-Linear Problems, convex and conic optimization problems among others. Applications I have been interested in include various branches of engineering, power systems, statistical learning, quantum information, and systems biology.

I completed a dual PhD at Polytechnique Montr√©al in the GERAD lab and INRIA / Centrale Lille, focusing on bilevel optimization problems, a decision-robust counterpart and application on pricing for demand response, and worked a while at the Zuse Institute Berlin.

On the side, I am working on various open-source projects, mostly in scientific programming, computational optimization, etc, in particular in the [Julia language](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/) and around the [JuMP](https://jump.dev) project.
