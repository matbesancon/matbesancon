### Hi, I'm Mathieu

<!--
**matbesancon/matbesancon** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm a researcher in mathematical optimization, working at the [Zuse Institute Berlin](https://www.zib.de).
I'm interested in leveraging problem structure and developing methods for various classes of problems, including MI(N)LPs, convex optimization problems among others.
Applications I have been interested in include various branches of engineering, power systems, and statistical learning.

On the side, I am working on various open-source projects, mostly in scientific programming, computational optimization, etc, in particular in the [Julia language](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/) and around the [JuMP](https://jump.dev) project.
